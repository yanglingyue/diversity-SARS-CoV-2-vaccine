#  Association of vaccination, international travel, public health and social measures with lineage dynamics of SARS-CoV-2

The international travel index was calculated from data on the travel patterns between cross-country by air or train, downloaded from Facebook Data for Good (https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/tools). The mobility data of Facebook is a non-public dataset. To access the data, please contact the corresponding author (tianhuaiyu@gmail.com).

The strength of public health and social measures (PHSM) is measured by the stringency index for non-vaccinated people, downloaded from the Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracer (OxCGRT) at: https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/covid-19-government-response-tracker. 

The analysis was performed using R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23).
